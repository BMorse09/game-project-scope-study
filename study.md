## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

1.   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
    I plan on having a minimalist layout, with a 9-space game board in the center
    of the page and a tally on the right side tracking wins, losses and ties for Player X
    and Player Y. There will be a New Game / Restart Game button below the game board,
    other than that the only other button on the page will be a login / signup icon
    on the top right of the header. May have a "TIC-TAC-TOE" headline in the header,
    thought I havent decided yet. Presentation will most likely be a black background
    with a white or yellow grid and game pieces. Minimalist. Speaking of game pieces,
    im considering using icons other than x's and o's just to spice it up a little.
    I would like to have a simple animation occur when a player wins, though not
    sure how I'll go about that just yet; I have an idea of what I want but I don't
    know yet how possible / feasible it would be. Will cross that bridge when I
    get to it. This is all laid out in the wireframe that I made.

2.   The data structure you plan to use.
    I will be using simple arrays, lists, classes and binaries for my data structure.
    WIll likely have a two-dimensional array for x's and o's. Will try to avoid
    using <span> and <divs>. Will only be using classes in CSS and HTML
    instead of ID's (Per Jeff's recommendation). Above all, really trying
    to keep everything as simple as possible.

3.   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS.
    I'll be representing my javascript through if / else loops and event handlers

4.   How you plan to approach this project.
    As I said prior, hoping to have a fully functional game that meets all the
    requirements while also keeping everything simple and easy to modify. The
    HTML and CSS of the "page" will be minimalist. Will begin by planning out
    each facet (data, presentation, style, DOM use, AJAX and JSON usage, etc)
    and then going from there.

5.   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    - As a user, I want to play tic tac toe against someone so we can have fun competing
    - As a user, I want to play tic tac toe against a computer so that I can have fun / compete
    - As a user, I want to create a username so that I can see past results from playing the game
    - As a user, I want to compete against someone else on a different computer

6.   How you plan to keep your code modular.
      I plan to keep my code modular by keeping different files for html, css,
      source code and jscript. I'll commiting constantly so as to maintain robust
      version control. I'll also be adhering to the observer event handler pattern.

7.   What creative spin will you add to your project.
      Really focusing on trying to meet all the requirements. As I stated above,
      presentation will be minimalist and modern looking. May choose something
      more creative to represent game pieces instead of just X's and O's.
      Hoping to have a simple animation upon a player victory.

8.   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
      I will be frequently commiting to GitHub and writing detailed commit messages
      so that I can properly track all my updates.

9.   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
      I do not foresee attempting any bonuses. Baby steps.
